            <tr>

                <td>Represents the dominant content of the <code class="codeInPara"><body></code> of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or
                    expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&ltarticle&gt</code></code></td>
                <td>Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&ltaside&gt</code></td>
                <td>Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main
                    content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&ltsection&gt</code></td>
                <td>Represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document.
                    Typically, but not always, sections have a heading.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><code>&ltnav&gt</code></td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&ltheader&gt</code></td>
                <td>Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&ltfooter&gt</code></td>
                <td>Represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&ltfigure&gt </code></td>
                <td>Represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the <code class="codeInPara">&ltfigcaption&gt</code> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&ltfigcaption&gt</code></td>
                <td>Represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent <code class="codeInPara">&ltfigure&gt</code> element.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&lttime&gt</code></td>
                <td>Represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.</td>
